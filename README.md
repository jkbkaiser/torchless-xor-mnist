# Torchless XOR/MNIST

This project contains an implementation of the Multi-Layer Perceptron from scratch with CUDA support.
The model is applied to the XOR problem and the MNIST dataset.
A detailed discussion on the necessary derivations can be found on my [blog](https://jakobkaiser.com/blog/torchless-xor-mnist/).
